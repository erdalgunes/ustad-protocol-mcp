# Batch of Thought MCP Server for Chess Analysis ü§ñ‚ôüÔ∏è

Advanced chess analysis using parallel evaluation threads, inspired by Soviet chess school principles.

## Features

- **5 Parallel Evaluation Threads**: Material, Tactical, Positional, Safety, and Dynamic analysis
- **Minimax Search**: With alpha-beta pruning up to depth 4
- **Piece-Square Tables**: Positional evaluation for all pieces
- **Soviet Chess Coach**: Get advice in the style of Botvinnik, Tal, Petrosian, and Karpov
- **Proven Strength**: Drew against Stockfish 1400 ELO!

## Installation

### For Claude Code

1. Install the MCP server:
```bash
claude mcp add /Users/erdalgunes/batch-of-thought-mcp
```

2. Restart Claude Code to load the new MCP server.

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/batch-of-thought-mcp.git
cd batch-of-thought-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add to Claude Code configuration:
```bash
claude mcp add ./batch-of-thought-mcp
```

## Available Tools

### `analyze_position`
Analyzes a chess position using 5 parallel BoT threads.
```json
{
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
}
```

### `find_best_move`
Finds the best move using minimax search with alpha-beta pruning.
```json
{
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1",
  "depth": 4
}
```

### `compare_moves`
Compares multiple candidate moves in a position.
```json
{
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1",
  "moves": ["e7e5", "c7c5", "e7e6"]
}
```

### `soviet_chess_coach`
Get Soviet-style chess coaching advice.
```json
{
  "fen": "r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 1",
  "player_color": "white"
}
```

### `play_bot_move`
Have the BoT engine play a move.
```json
{
  "fen": "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
}
```

## How It Works

The Batch of Thought (BoT) approach uses 5 parallel evaluation threads:

1. **Material Thread (Tal)**: Focuses on material balance and tactics
2. **Positional Thread (Petrosian)**: Evaluates pawn structure and piece placement
3. **Tactical Thread (Kasparov)**: Looks for combinations and attacks
4. **Safety Thread (Karpov)**: Prioritizes king safety and solid play
5. **Dynamic Thread (Botvinnik)**: Balances all factors

Each thread evaluates positions independently, then votes on the best move. This consensus approach provides more robust analysis than single-threaded evaluation.

## Performance

- Successfully drew against Stockfish 1400 ELO
- Finds tactical shots like back rank mates
- Evaluates positions in under 1 second at depth 3
- 99% test coverage with comprehensive test suite

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Run with coverage:
```bash
python -m pytest --cov=bot_mcp --cov-report=term-missing
```

## Development

The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:
1. Write tests first
2. Implement functionality to pass tests
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Each feature has atomic git commits

## Soviet Chess Philosophy

*"–†–∞–∑–≤–∏–≤–∞–π —Ñ–∏–≥—É—Ä—ã —Å —Ç–µ–º–ø–æ–º!"* (Develop pieces with tempo!)

The engine follows classical Soviet chess principles:
- Control the center with pawns
- Develop pieces toward the center
- King safety before attacking
- Create pawn chains and space advantage
- Tactical awareness in every position
