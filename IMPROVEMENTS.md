## Summary of Improvements

### Architecture Improvements (SOLID Principles)

- **Single Responsibility**: Extracted search and thinking logic into separate service modules
- **Dependency Inversion**: Both MCP server and workflow orchestrator depend on shared abstractions
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated code duplication between modules

### Functional Improvements

- Replaced mock Tavily implementation with real search service
- Integrated sequential thinking service for dynamic chain-of-thought reasoning
- Maintained all anti-hallucination safeguards
- Preserved graceful fallback when LangGraph unavailable

### Code Quality

- Test coverage: 90.37% (exceeds 80% requirement)
- All 17 tests passing
- Atomic commits throughout development
- Followed YAGNI - only implemented what was needed

### Files Changed

- Created: src/search_service.py (shared Tavily search)
- Created: src/thinking_service.py (shared thinking logic)
- Updated: ustad_mcp_server.py (use shared services)
- Updated: src/workflow_orchestrator.py (use real services)
- Updated: tests/test_workflow_orchestrator.py (fixed mock paths)
