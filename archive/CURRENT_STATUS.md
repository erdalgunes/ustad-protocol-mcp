## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Critical Issues

1. **Memory Leak in Long Sessions**

   - Sessions >1 hour show memory growth
   - Temporary fix: Session timeout at 45 min
   - Permanent fix: Implement proper cleanup

1. **Race Condition in Concurrent Requests**

   - Rare perspective collision (0.1% of requests)
   - Current mitigation: Request queuing
   - Fix needed: Proper synchronization

### Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Perspective Generation Latency**

   - Each perspective: 200-400ms
   - 8 perspectives sequential: 2-3s total
   - Solution: Parallel generation (in progress)

1. **Token Inefficiency**

   - Redundant context in each round
   - Average 8000 tokens per analysis
   - Solution: Context compression algorithm

### Functional Limitations

1. **Domain Specificity**

   - Best performance in software/research
   - Weaker in creative/artistic domains
   - Requires domain-specific tuning

1. **Language Constraints**

   - English-only processing
   - Cultural biases in reasoning
   - No multilingual perspective diversity
