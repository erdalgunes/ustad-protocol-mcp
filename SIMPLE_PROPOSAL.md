# The Ustad Protocol: A Simple Research Proposal

## The Problem (One Sentence)

AI assistants make mistakes because they think alone - humans make better decisions in groups.

## The Solution (One Paragraph)

Make AI think in groups. Instead of one AI giving you an answer, have 3 AIs discuss it first:

1. **Optimist** - "Here's how to do it"
1. **Critic** - "Here's what could go wrong"
1. **Realist** - "Here's what actually works"

They talk, disagree, then agree on the best answer.

## Why It's Called "Ustad"

"Ustad" means "master teacher" - wisdom comes from discussion, not monologue.

## Phase 1: Make It Work (Month 1)

### Minimum Viable Product

```python
# This is ALL we need first:
async def ustad_think(question):
    optimist = get_perspective(question, "optimistic")
    critic = get_perspective(question, "critical")
    realist = get_perspective(question, "realistic")

    discussion = discuss(optimist, critic, realist)
    consensus = find_agreement(discussion)

    return consensus
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Works with Claude Code's MCP
- [ ] Takes \<5 seconds
- [ ] Costs \<$0.01 per use
- [ ] Better than single response 60% of time

## Phase 2: Make It Useful (Month 2)

### Add What Users Actually Need

1. **Memory**: Remember what was discussed
1. **Speed**: Cache common patterns
1. **Clarity**: Explain the reasoning
1. **Control**: Let users pick perspectives

### Integration with CLAUDE.md

```markdown
# In CLAUDE.md:
When user asks complex question:
1. Use ustad_think automatically
2. Show: "Consulting multiple perspectives..."
3. Return consensus answer
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 3: Make It Better (Month 3)

### Only After It Works

- Add more perspectives (but only if needed)
- Improve consensus algorithm
- Reduce costs
- Speed optimization

______________________________________________________________________

## Research Questions (Keep It Simple)

1. **Does group AI thinking reduce errors?**

   - Test: 100 factual questions
   - Measure: Error rate before/after
   - Target: 30% reduction

1. **Is it worth the extra time/cost?**

   - Test: User preference study
   - Measure: Would users pay 3x for 30% better answers?
   - Target: 70% say yes

1. **What's the minimum viable discussion?**

   - Test: 2 vs 3 vs 5 perspectives
   - Measure: Quality vs cost
   - Target: Find sweet spot

## Current Reality Check

### What We Have

- ✅ Basic Python prototype (25% done)
- ✅ Good concept
- ✅ Initial MCP structure

### What We Don't Have

- ❌ Working integration
- ❌ Any testing
- ❌ Real measurements

### What We Need First

1. Make the basic 3-perspective version work
1. Connect it to Claude Code
1. Test on 10 real questions
1. Measure if it's actually better

## Implementation Plan (Real & Simple)

### Week 1-2: Basic Prototype

```python
# Just make this work:
- ustad_think(question) -> answer
- 3 perspectives max
- Simple voting for consensus
```

### Week 3-4: Claude Integration

```python
# Make it usable:
- MCP server that actually runs
- CLAUDE.md can call it
- Returns in <5 seconds
```

### Week 5-6: Testing

```python
# Prove it works:
- 100 test questions
- Compare to GPT-4 baseline
- Document improvements
```

### Week 7-8: Polish

```python
# Make it production-ready:
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Examples
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Budget & Resources

### Minimal Requirements

- **Time**: 2 months part-time
- **Cost**: ~$100 in API credits for testing
- **Team**: 1 developer + testers
- **Tools**: OpenAI API, Python, MCP

### Not Required (Avoid Over-Engineering)

- ❌ Complex infrastructure
- ❌ Multiple models
- ❌ Database
- ❌ Web interface
- ❌ 8 perspectives (start with 3)

______________________________________________________________________

## Success Metrics (Keep It Real)

### Month 1 Success

- [ ] 3-perspective discussion works
- [ ] Integrated with Claude Code
- [ ] 10 successful test runs

### Month 2 Success

- [ ] 30% error reduction proven
- [ ] 100 test cases passed
- [ ] 5 real users tried it

### Month 3 Success

- [ ] Published simple paper/blog
- [ ] Open-sourced code
- [ ] 50+ GitHub stars

______________________________________________________________________

## Why This Will Actually Work

1. **It's Simple**: 3 perspectives, not 8
1. **It's Focused**: Just reduce errors
1. **It's Measurable**: Clear success metrics
1. **It's Useful**: Solves real problem
1. **It's Buildable**: 2 months, not 8

## Call to Action

### For Developers

"Help us build the simplest version that could work"

### For Users

"Try our 3-perspective AI and tell us if it's better"

### For Researchers

"Here's a simple idea that might actually work"

______________________________________________________________________

## The Anti-Over-Engineering Pledge

We promise to:

- ✅ Start with 3 perspectives, not 8
- ✅ Use one model (GPT-3.5), not multiple
- ✅ Build one tool, not a framework
- ✅ Solve one problem (errors), not everything
- ✅ Ship in 2 months, not 8
