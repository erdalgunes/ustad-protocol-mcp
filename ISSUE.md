# Issue #3: Create basic LangGraph state machine

## Original Issue Body

## Time Estimate: 3-4 hours

## Description

Add minimal LangGraph workflow with 3 states: Analyze → Verify → Execute. This enforces the cognitive scaffolding pattern where we must understand intent and verify facts before executing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `src/workflow_orchestrator.py` with simple state machine
- [ ] Add `langgraph` to dependencies (optional, graceful fallback)
- [ ] States: IntentState → VerifyState → ExecuteState
- [ ] Unit tests for state transitions (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Works alongside existing code (not integrated yet)
- [ ] Use Tavily to search "LangGraph state machine best practices"
- [ ] Make atomic commits for each state implementation
- [ ] Don't give up if state transitions fail - add proper error recovery

## Technical Requirements

- Use sequential thinking (10+ steps) to design state flow
- Apply SOLID: Each state has single responsibility
- Search for "LangGraph workflow patterns" using Tavily
- Implement retry logic for failed state transitions
- TDD: Write state transition tests first

## State Definitions

```python
class WorkflowState(TypedDict):
    intent: str
    needs_verification: bool
    facts_to_verify: List[str]
    verification_results: Dict[str, Any]
    thinking_steps: List[str]  # Must have minimum 10 steps
    execution_result: Any

# State flow
IntentState: Analyze what user really needs
VerifyState: Use Tavily to fact-check any claims
ExecuteState: Process with validated information
```

## Key Features

- Enforce minimum 10 thinking steps
- Automatic fact-checking trigger
- State persistence for debugging
- Graceful degradation if LangGraph unavailable

## Anti-Hallucination Design

- VerifyState MUST run if facts detected
- Cannot skip to ExecuteState without verification
- Log all fact-checking attempts for audit
